## About the project

Ditsmod is a Node.js web framework, named **DI** + **TS** + **Mod** to emphasize its important components: it has **D**ependency **I**njection, written in **T**ype**S**cript, and designed for good **Mod**ularity. Some of the architecture concepts of this framework are taken from [Angular][9].

It's beta version of `@ts-stack/ditsmod`. Work in progress.
