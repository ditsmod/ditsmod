The [examples][1] folder contains examples of using Ditsmod for typical cases. They are easier to view if you clone the Ditsmod repository and set the npm dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ditsmod/ditsmod.git
cd ditsmod
yarn
```

Then you can run one of the applications, experiment with them, and immediately see the result.

Each example has README.md, which briefly describes its main features.
