# 01-hello-world

To try this example, you should first [prepare the prerequisite][1].

`01-hello-world` is the simplest example with minimal settings. Only the `RouterModule` for routing
and one controller with one route are imported into the root module.

Launch the application from the first terminal:

```bash
yarn start1
```

From the second terminal check the work:

```bash
curl -isS localhost:3000
```
