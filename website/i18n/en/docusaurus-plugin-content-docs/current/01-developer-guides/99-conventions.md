# Ditsmod coding style guide

Here is the recommended format in the form of a pair "file name" - "class name":

- `hello-world.module.ts` - `HelloWorldModule`;
- `hello-world.controller.ts` - `HelloWorldController`;
- `hello-world.service.ts` - `HelloWorldService`;
- `auth.guard.ts` - `AuthGuard`.

That is,

1. the names of any files must contain only lowercase letters;
2. if there are several words in the file name, you should separate them with a hyphen;
3. class roles must precede the extension and must be preceded by a dot (`*.module.ts`, `*.controller.ts`, `*.service.ts`, `*.guard.ts`);
4. class names must start with a capital letter, and contain exactly the same words as in the name of their files, but in the style of [CamelCase][1].
5. End-to-end tests should be kept in a separate directory named `e2e`, at the same level as the `src` root directory.

It is recommended to call the root module - `AppModule`.

When importing, it is recommended not to mix import from local files and import from `node_modules`. At the top are imports from `node_modules`, and then retreating one line are local imports:

```ts
import { injectable, Status } from '@ditsmod/core';
import { CanActivate } from '@ditsmod/rest';

import { AuthService } from './auth.service.js';
import { Permission } from './permission.js';
```

Extension group token names must end in `_EXTENSIONS`, such as `MY_EXTENSIONS`.
