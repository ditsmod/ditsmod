# 15-i18n

You can read the documentation for `@ditsmod/i18n` in the [published modules section][1], you can view the code with examples of the use of `@ditsmod/i18n` in the [Ditsmod repository][2], although it is more convenient to view it locally, so it is better first clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ditsmod/ditsmod.git
cd ditsmod
yarn
yarn boot
```

The example can be run with the command:

```bash
yarn start15
```
